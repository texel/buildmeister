= Buildmeister

Managing your build process is fun and easy!

== Description

Buildmeister provides some simple utilities for managing a small team's build process
using Lighthouse and Github.

== Features

- Growl notification of updated build status
- Utility scripts to batch move tickets
- A very handy utility for pruning local and remote git branches

== Examples
  # To start periodically updated growl notifications...
  $ buildmeister notify
  
  # To move all tickets in a bin to a particular state...
  $ buildmeister move_all --from-bin "Staged" --to-state "verified"
  
  # Clean up local git branches
  $ git_cleanup local
  
  # Clean up git branches on origin
  $ git_cleanup remote
  
  # Print a summary of tickets in a bin and copy it to the clipboard
  $ buildmeister summary -b "Verified"

== Requirements

Depends on lighthouse, activesupport, and growlnotify.

== Install

- Download and install Growl from http://growl.info/
- sudo gem install buildmeister
- Use the included config/buildmeister_config.sample.yml file as a guide to creating your own configuration file.
The file should be called ".buildmeister_config.yml", and be placed in your home directory.

== TODO
  
- Generalize remote git cleanup so that it doesn't explicitly refer to origin
- Break Lighthouse Utilities out into their own gem
